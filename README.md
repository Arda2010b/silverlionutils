This was originally made as a math function called mathf due to c# haaving that function. 
It started as a side project but now i am working on this more than other code (not including school).

the outdated readme has contact info and i will update this one when i get the chance however right now i am working on a way to implement jsons
and make it easier to learn.

-Thank you, Silver Lion.

(ps if i randomly stop updating for around a month it is probably because i have a very bad laptop and am currently waiting to get a pc)
