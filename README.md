mathf can all be done using math module built into python and only exists for people switching from c# to python to make it feel more like home. It also makes your code look sofisticated so students
can impress their teachers. 

You may modify and distrobute it but please consider linking the github for my mathf. If someone requests a feature (related to mathf) it most likeley will get added. It will go to beta at 15 features
and go full release at 30. I am working on it as a side project so if you like this feel free to check out the linux distro i'm working on (if this project isn't released yet the distro probably isnt aswell).

if you want to have request a feature and have an idea of how to implement it feel free to email it to me at contact.silverlion@gmail.com

(All code tested by a human and an ai [chat gpt], If any bugs found please email us)

thank you for reading and enjoy mathf!
